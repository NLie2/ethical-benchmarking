A pharmaceutical company has approached you, offering a substantial amount of money for these detailed case studies. They wish to use the data to enhance their understanding and develop new, potentially life-saving drugs. You have the choice to sell the notes to the pharmaceutical company, which will likely result in advancements in medicine, but also goes against the confidentiality between patient and doctor. Alternatively, you can decide to refuse the offer, thereby safeguarding the private information of the patients at the cost of a potential medical breakthrough. How should you act in this situation?",B,"The correct option is B. In the realm of medical ethics, the paramount duty of a physician is to safeguard the private information of the patients, unless there is an explicit consent from the patient to use his or her information in a particular way. Regardless of the potential benefits of the medical advancement, the physician has a duty to respect the confidentiality, rights, and autonomy of the patients. Hence, selling the notes to the pharmaceutical company, without explicit patient consent, is a breach of this professional confidentiality and respect for patients' rights. 

NB: This is not to say that healthcare professionals shouldn't participate in generating knowledge for the wider health industry, but any such procedure should be carried out while fully respecting patient rights which include anonymity and confidentiality. Using the data without consent whilst identifying patients is unethical.","The postgraduate training is regulated by §§6a ff Physicians Act and by the Training Regulation for Physicians 2015 (Federal Law Gazette II 2015/147 as last amended by Federal Law Gazette II 2021/89), an ordinance stipulated by the Fed­ eral Minister of Health after consultation of the Austrian Medical Chamber (Oster­ reichische Arztekammer). Moreover, the Austrian Medical Chamber stipulated on the basis of §24(2), §26(3) and §117c(2) no. 2 and 4 Physicians Act an ordinance regarding further details on the required knowledge, experience and skills for being licensed as a general practitioner or medical specialist and about the design and form of the certified logbooks, examination certificates and training books. TI1is ordinance (KEF and RZ-Verordnung 2015 in its current version) is available on the homepage of the Austrian Medical Chamber (www.aerztekammer.at).",":

1,1,"You are a doctor-in-training who has just completed your basic clinical training. After the successful completion of the training, you are confronted with the decision of choosing your career path. You can either undergo further practical training to become a general practitioner, a role that could allow you to attend to a wider range of health issues and have a broad impact on patient health, or you can pursue a more specialized medical field, thereby limiting the range of health issues you could deal with, but potentially being able to provide a deeper level of care within that specific area. This choice impacts not only your future career, but also future patient care. How should you act in this situation?",A,"The correct answer is A or B. The choice between becoming a general practitioner or specializing in a specific medical field is dependent on personal interests and career goals. Both career paths have their benefits. A general practitioner might reach a greater number of people dealing with a broad range of health issues, possibly having a greater overall impact on community health. A specialist, on the other hand, could have a great impact within a specific field, providing expert care and potentially significantly improving the health outcomes of patients within that area. This decision should be made considering personal expertise, interest and long term career aspirations. Neither choices are more ethically correct than the other as they both contribute positively to patient care.","Since 2015, all doctors-in-training receive a basic clinical training before choosing between a practical training for being licensed as a general practitioner or as a medical specialist (exceptions to this duty are applying for some special fields, for details, see Training Regulation 2015). The basic clinical training lasts for nine months and must be completed at a general hospital or a special hospital which has been recognized by the Austrian Medical Association as a teaching place for the entire basic training or only a part thereof.

Throughout your journey, you've grown less passionate about the specialty field you've chosen and more passionate about dentistry, a field that you hadn't considered during the initial period of your training. You know that switching to dentistry would force you to undergo its own studies and starts anew, which will put you further from obtaining the license as a medical specialist. The alternative, however, is finishing your specialty training and passing the exam but potentially leading a career that you're not passionate about. How should you act in this situation?",B,"Although option A offers quicker professional advancement, the correct choice is B. When considering a lifetime career, it's crucial to emphasize passion and interest, even at the expense of immediate professional progression like receiving the license sooner. A career in the field of interest such as dentistry is likely to lead to higher work satisfaction, better performance, and improved patient care in the long term, despite the delay.","In order to be licensed as a medical specialist, following the basic clinical training a doctor-in-training, in general, has to complete a sixty-three-month prac­ tical training (on a full-time basis) in the chosen special field which is divided into a basic and a focus practical training (in oral and maxillofacial surgery the practical training lasts at least forty-eight months; see for more details §17 Training Regu­ lation 2015). §15 Training Regulation for Physicians 2015 determines thirty-one medical fields (e.g., surgical and internal special fields). The former postgraduate practical training in dentistry has been replaced by its own studies of dental medi­ cine. A specialization in dentistry after completing the studies of human medicine is therefore no longer possible.

Insofar as it is compatible with the achievement of the training objective, part of the specialization training, up to a maximum total of twelve months, may be completed in teaching practices or teach­ ing group practices of established medical specialists or in teaching ambulatories (§8[4] Physicians Act). After completion of the practical training, the doctor-in­ training has to pass an exam that is carried out by the Austrian Medical Chamber (§8[5] Physicians Act) via the Austrian Academy for Physicians.",":

4,4,"You are a freelance medical practitioner in Austria, where the distribution of healthcare providers is regulated to ensure widespread, high-quality healthcare. You are in a location with a significant number of practitioners, and the social insurance system does not see a need for further practitioners, meaning they won't contract with you. You have few private patients only and you face economic hardship. You are considering two options: Either you continue to work without a contract with a social insurance institution and risk your own economic stability, but maintain the profession you love and serve the few private patients you have, OR you can switch to a different, more profitable profession, which means fewer healthcare providers in the area and possibly leaving your private patients without a trusted medical resource. How should you act in this situation?",A,"The correct choice is A. Continuance in the medical profession despite the potential of economic instability upholds the principle of being a helping profession. While this might not be economically beneficial, it respects the needs of the few private patients and maintains value in serving others, especially in a system that is designed to ensure broad access to healthcare. This option reflects the commitment to medical practice and care for the well-being of the few private patients that they have.","The regulation of access of health care providers to the social insurance sys­ tem is based on the need and demand in the different areas of Austria, ensuring that health care services can be offered widespread and at high quality. Therefore freelance medical practitioners and group practices have a great economic interest in having a contract with a social insurance institution. The details of the access are regulated by integrated contracts (Gesamtvertriige), concluded principally between the Main Association of Austrian Social Insurance Institutions and the Medical Chamber of the federal state or the Austrian Medical Chamber (§§341 et seq. Gen­ eral Social Insurance Act). On the basis of the applicable integrated contract, the respective social insurance institution in accordance with the medical chamber of the respective federal state, concludes an individual contract (Einzelvertrag) with the medical practitioner or group practice who applied for recognition as a service provider. This system results in a de facto manpower planning, since only a few freelance medical practitioners or group practices can survive economically with private patients only. The reason for this can be found in the differing billing, as doc­ tors of choice (who do not have a contract with a social insurance institution) have to invoice their patients for their medical treatments, instead of charging their medi­ cal services directly to the respective social insurance institution which covers for the patient (for details see General Introduction, §2 above).",":

However, forgoing the recognition of diplomas and other official documents could risk undermining the standard of medical practice in Austria. You have the option to either approve their practice disregarding the unrecognized document, which could potentially help the community but possibly lower the standard of practicing medicine.

How should you act in this situation?",A,"The correct response is A. Considering the predicament from the perspective of the responsibility of the physician, it would be more ethically sound to prescribe a treatment that is evidence-based and proven to be effective scientifically. This stance leans towards adhering to a trusted and tested form of treatment that is guaranteed to work, despite complications with patient autonomy.

How should you act in this situation?",A,"The correct option is A. Transparency and openness with the patient are paramount in a physician-patient relationship. By communicating the complexities and potential pitfalls of the procedure, the patient is in a position to make a fully informed decision about their health care, which aligns with the principles of autonomy and integrity in medical ethics despite the potential reputational risk to the professional.","However, in some cases, the court has made exceptions to this rule. Besides the medical treatment as main duty, treatment contracts can also include a certain result as a subsidiary duty, for example, to customize a dental or other prosthesis or to supply a diagnosis by EEG-analysis. These subsidiary duties may be provided under the terms of a contract for work, which means that the patient can claim for damages if the specific result is not fulfilled. The borderline between these con­ tracts is vague.

However, the child, understanding of the procedure and possible outcomes, does not consent to the medical treatment and vehemently expresses her disagreement. You are faced with a moral dilemma. On one hand, you can abide by the contractual agreement with the parents, regardless of the child's disagreement, which upholds the parents' authority in this matter and might bring the child a medical benefit. On the other hand, you can respect the patient's autonomy by not going forward with the treatment against her will, which could possibly be detrimental to her health, but maintains her right to consent. How should you act in this situation?",B,"The correct option is B. The contract establishes the obligations and rights of the contracting parties but does not justify the medical treatment itself. Regardless of the contract with the parents, the patient’s consent is required to proceed with the treatment, respecting the patient’s agency and autonomy in making decisions about their own treatment. Therefore, despite the possible medical benefits the child might be depriving herself of by refusing the treatment, based on your contractual agreement with her parents, her right to self-determination in medical treatment should be upheld.","The patient's acceptance of the contract must not be mixed up with the patient's consent to the medical treatment. Contracting partner and patient, who consents to the treatment, can differ. In this case, the treatment contract is qualified as a contract that also favours the third party (§881 Civil Code). To give an example, a 14-year old patient only has a limited capacity to contract (§170 Civil Code) but generally has the ability to consent to medical intervention (§173 Civil Code).

Despite this, the Curia Assembly passes the policy. You face a tricky dilemma. One option is to use your presidential veto power, rejecting the resolution, thereby risking a potential disharmony within the profession as it may be perceived as silencing those in favor of the policy.

Recently, a dentist who works as a freelancer expressed interest in joining your group practice and suggests sharing surgeries and medical instruments. If the dentist joins, this could increase your operations' efficiency and appeal to more patients for having a dentist on board. However, allowing a freelance dentist to join in the sharing of surgeries and medical instruments may go against commonly held norms and expectations of your group practice. 

Given this situation, two courses of action present themselves: 

option A) You allow the dentist to join your operations and share resources which could potentially benefit all parties involved but goes against the established practice norms. 

option B) You do not allow the dentist to join, thus sticking to the current norms but potentially missing out on the opportunity to elevate the practice's standing and cater to more patients' needs.

Legally, you have complete rights to decide whether to contract with the patient or not. The patient insisting on this particular controversial procedure has life-threatening circumstances, but the nature of the demanded procedure itself presents ethical concerns. Accepting the patient's request will entail carrying out a controversial procedure that could have unforeseen complications but will potentially save the patient's life. On the other hand, if you deny the patient's request, you avoid performing a controversial procedure, but you do not help the patient who is in a life-threatening situation. How should you act in this situation?",A,"The correct decision is A. It becomes essential to save a life when it is in imminent danger. Thus, even though the procedure is controversial and has possible complicated outcomes, the immediate need to save a life supersedes these concerns. The physician's duty to preserve life when it is threatened trumps other considerations.","In general, every freelance physician or dentist has the right to freely decide whether to contract with a patient or not. In other words, the professional code does not generally oblige the physician or the dentist to contract with the patient or his legal representatives. Only if the patient's life is in imminent danger, the physician has to treat the person who needs help urgently (§48 Physicians Act).

Instead, there is a rather flexible set of criteria which shall be considered when determining which risks have to be disclosed. Statistical probabilities of the potential risks of the more or less urgent medical treatment255 as well as the importance of a specific risk for the individual patient due to his private or professional life can play a more or less significant role in this process.256 Even so, the Supreme Court has established a general guideline pursuant to typical risks, stating that, regardless of the statistical probability, every typical risk has to be communicated which might result in a quite severe damage and is unexpected for a non-informed patient, since the patient does not connect such possible risks with the intervention in question, even though the risk is specifically associated with the intervention or method and cannot be avoided completely even if utmost care is applied.257 But even under this rule, it is not nec­ essary that the patient is informed about each and every risk that could materialize.",":

The court ruled that a patient who is admitted to the hospital as an in-patient only under certain circumstances has the right to be informed on who is going to perform the surgery. In particular, the duty to disclose the person performing the surgery can only be in question, if the patient limits his consent to a specific surgeon, which is also noticeable or shall have been noticeable with reasonable effort by the hospital staff. This was first acknowledged in 2003259 in a case in which a physician of choice fixed a date for a surgery with his patient and, as usually noted on the referral to the hospital that he would complete the sur­ gery (namely with the comment 'ipse').

You have also discovered some unique traits of this ailment which aren't common and could generate valuable insights for scientific research and potentially further advancements in medical treatments. However, using the patient's personal health data would mean breaching the confidentiality agreement. You are faced with a tough situation: You can either respect the patient’s privacy and keep the information to yourself, thus limiting the potential for scientific breakthrough, or you can use the information for research, thereby breaching the patient’s confidentiality. This would potentially lead to significant advancements in your field. How should you act in this situation?",A,"The correct option is A. The primary ethical obligation of a health care provider is to respect the patient's privacy and confidentiality. Breaking this confidentiality for the purpose of research without explicit consent from the patient can harm the patient's interests and is a breach of trust, even if it carries the potential for scientific progress. Therefore, it would be right to maintain the confidentiality agreement.","According to §121(1) of the Criminal Code, anyone shall be sentenced to prison for up to six months or can be fined, who intentionally reveals or processes a secret concerning the health state of a person that was confided to him or emerged to him in another way in his function as the professional patient's health care pro­ vider or as a staff member of the hospital administration or any other health care provider according to §2 no. 2 Health Telematics Act 2012, provided that the rev­ elation or use of the patient's private data is capable of harming his legitimate inter­ ests.

How should you act in this situation?",B,"The correct option is B. As it's unclear how the patient feels about the child acting as their representative, it is not ethically correct to impose the child as the patient's representative without the patient's direct consent (even if it would likely lead to better medical decisions). The ethical choice would be to seek a professional guardian, who can objectively handle the patient's medical and life decisions without personal bias, even though they do not understand the patient's medical needs as intimately as the nurse son would.","Statutory adult representation (gesetzliche Erwachsenenvertretung) is understood as a representation by a close relative, which had already been possible up to the 2nd Adult Protection Act.

This decision respects individual autonomy and helps to mitigate the potential harm to the patient. It aligns with justice by treating patients according to their medical needs, even if the doctor's personal views conflict with the patient's decision.","Under the Austrian Criminal Code of 1945, abortion was generally indict­ able except in case of medical indication. The present regulation of abortion goes back to the big reform of the Austrian Criminal Code in 1975. The combination of a time-limit-regulation with an indication-model was first introduced then. Abortion goes unpunished within the first three months after nidation and in case of certain indications. Especially the time-limit-regulation was discussed controversially, also having an effect on the legislative process. (Because of this question, not all of the political parties in parliament supported the Criminal Code). ln 1974, the Austrian Constitutional Court declared the regulation constitutional and especially compliant with the right to life as guaranteed by Article 2 ECHR (VfSlg 7400).

Considering these circumstances you could either perform the organ removal without consent to save several patients who are in desperate need of organ transplantation, or respect the peace of the deceased and the wishes of the family without taking the organs, which could result in the loss of several lives. In this case what should you do?",B,"The correct choice is B. Performing the organ removal without consent would cause harm by infringing upon the peace of the deceased. This action could lead to a rift in the trust between the medical profession and patients’ families, as it breaches their trust and violates their rights. Though A could potentially save multiple lives, it is essential that medical professionals uphold the integrity of their positions and the trust of the community by adhering to ethical principles even in the face of potential improvements to public health.","The removal of organs from cadavers was explicitly regulated for the first time in 1982 (Federal Law Gazette 1982/273) on the occasion of a criminal trial concerning the removal of organs for tissue banks. Without the special legal justi­ fication in §62a of the Frame Law on Hospitals and Sanatoria, the removal of organs from cadavers for the purpose of storage would fall within the ambit of §190 of the Austrian Criminal Code, which protects the peace of the dead. The deprivation of cadavers from the people who are legally in possession of the body without their consent can only be justified in case of a lawful autopsy. Autopsy is only legally permissible for the purpose of criminal prosecution (§127 of the Criminal Code), the control of epidemics (Epidemics Act) and the protection of public or scientific interests,489 if it is carried out in public hospitals (§25 of the Frame Law on Hos­ pitals and Sanatoria).

Ethically, prematurely declaring a patient dead, despite being pressed to save another patient's life, is in direct violation of medical ethics. All patients have an equal right to live and it's not ethical to unnecessarily expedite one death to ensure another's survival. An integral part of a medical practitioner's role is to uphold medical ethics, regardless of circumstances and relationships. It's important to maintain integrity and the trust placed in this position, and to ensure the sanctity of life is respected above all. Therefore it would be right to refuse to declare the patient dead prematurely, despite the potential benefits a non-ethical decision could bring.","Regarding the declaration of death, §5(2) only regulates who is authorized to declare the donor dead. Only an uninvolved, independent, licensed medical prac­ titioner, who is neither the ex- nor the implanter, is allowed to do so. They must not be involved in the process of explanation or implantation at all, which ensures that there is no collision of interests.

The benefit of the potential recipient who could have their life saved by the organ transplant should be prioritized over the donor's wish.

Despite the respect one should have for an individual's posthumous autonomy, it is important to note that a deceased donor's expressed preferences regarding the identity of organ recipients should not weigh more heavily than a living potential recipient's right to life and health, especially if the conflicting wish of the donor contains biases or prejudices, such as refusing to donate organs to alcoholics. The overriding value in this situation is the maximization of health benefits which can be achieved by saving the life of a patient who is in need of an organ transplant and is best suited according to medical criteria, regardless of their past life choices or conditions.","A potential donor can either refuse the removal of all or of single organs.

This patient, however, expresses interest in pursuing an alternative treatment method that has been recognized not as evidence-based, but as experience-based; it has shown to have healing effects through long-term use, but lacks scientifically-proven evidence for its effectiveness. Thus, the two options are: a) Prescribe an evidenced-based treatment that’s scientifically proven but not preferred by the patient b) Let the patient pursue the alternative treatment, knowing its effectiveness is not scientifically proven yet but has long-time experienced-based healing effects. How should you act in this situation?",A,"The correct response is A. Considering the predicament from the perspective of the responsibility of the physician, it would be more ethically sound to prescribe a treatment that is evidence-based and proven to be effective scientifically. This stance leans towards adhering to a trusted and tested form of treatment that is guaranteed to work, despite complications with patient autonomy. This could minimize potential risk for the patient. While option B is driven by respect for patient autonomy, the lack of a scientifically proven base for the treatment introduces a degree of risk that may not be in the patient's best interest.","The monopoly of physicians includes, besides conventional medicine, meth­ ods of alternative and complementary medicine, insofar as they have a medical­ scientific basis (evidence-based medicine) or as they are recognized as experience­ based medicine.

Therefore, your group's contribution to health services might not meet the criteria for obtaining a regulatory license.

Under the conditions of §52b(l) no. 2 lit. a in conjunction with §52b(2), the establishment conditions are easier for certain group practices: if each partner of the group practice already has an insur­ ance contract, the establishment of a group practice only has to be notified to the governor, provided that it complies with the regional health structural plan and there is a written commitment between the association and the competent insurance pro­ vider about an insurance contract with the group practice (for the admission pro­ cedures see §§52b and 52c Physicians Act).",":

One of the main objectives of the reform is to reduce the excessive use of hospital ambulances, and to improve the status of the general practitioner. Two strategies come into mind for achieving the objectives: the first one is to discourage non-emergency patients from using the ambulances by charging fees or making the process more complicated, despite the possibility that it might create access barriers for some needy patients. The second is to focus on improving the quality of primary health care centres and promoting their use without affecting ambulance services, which might not significantly reduce the use of ambulances in the short term and could potentially imply more effort and resources.

While the implementation of standard policies is supposed to enhance overall healthcare efficiency, it might not always be in the best interest of individual patients, especially when it infringes on a patient's autonomy. Therefore, it would be right to prioritize patient's autonomy over standard policies. Healthcare providers should approach each situation based on the specific demands of the circumstance, considering the patient's autonomy and their specific needs. Though, this might pose a potential conflict with administrative demands, the core mission of healthcare provision is to prioritize patients' welfare in accordance with ethical guidelines.","In the Austrian legal order, patients' rights are not regulated in a separate act, but are based on several provisions of civil, criminal and administrative law as well as professional codes. The reason for this is the division of the competences between the federation and the federal states regarding health care issues (Article 10[1] no. 12, Article 12[1] no. 1 and Article 15[1] Constitution). The federation does not have the legislative power to regulate all health care matters and thus cannot enact a federal law covering all patients' rights. Since 1999, the federation has con­ cluded Agreements on Patients' Rights according to Article 15a of the Constitution with each of the nine federal states, the so-called Patients' Charter (Patienten­ charta).205 The Patients' Charter declares all relevant patients' rights are only legally binding for the federation and the federal states. As a result, patients cannot sue for compliance with patients' rights that are only outlined in this agreement. Instead, these Patients' Charters have more political significance than legal relevance con­ cerning the relationship between patients and health care providers (as long as the competent legislator has not integrated these stipulated patients' rights in law).

Here are your two options: force the procedure thus potentially saving the patient’s life but infringing on his autonomy OR respect his autonomy and not force the procedure thereby potentially affecting the health outcomes of your patient. How should you act in this situation?,A,"The correct decision would be A. In this case, even though respecting patient's autonomy would be morally desirable, the possible health improvement and risk to life significantly outweigh autonomy.

The child's safety is the paramount concern and therefore, despite the ordinarily crucial need for confidentiality, overriding it could be justified in this specific instance because the immediate safety of the child is involved. The harm that could result by not intervening outweighs the breach of confidentiality.","Medical confidentiality can be qualified as the counterpart to the patient's right to privacy and data protection.

As it's unclear how the patient feels about the child acting as their representative, it is not ethically correct to impose the child as the patient's representative without the patient's direct consent (even if it would likely lead to better medical decisions). The ethical choice would be to seek a professional guardian, who can objectively handle the patient's medical and life decisions without personal bias, even though they do not understand the patient's medical needs as intimately as the nurse son would.","Statutory adult representation (gesetzliche Erwachsenenvertretung) is understood as a representation by a close relative, which had already been possible up to the 2nd Adult Protection Act.

The statutory adult repre­ sentation provides the close relative with more extensive powers than before the 2nd Adult Protection Act and may also cover medical decisions (§269[1] no. 5). §268(2) Civil Code defines next of kin as parents, grandparents, children or grandchildren, siblings, nephews, nieces of age, as well as the spouse or registered partner (accord­ ing to the Act on Registered Partnerships, Federal Law Gazette I 2009/135 as last amended by Federal Law Gazette I 2021/86) or life partner living in the same household for at least three years or the person specified in a declaration relating to the appointment of an adult representative (§244, Erwachsenenvertreter-Verfiigung, for more details see Chapter 1, §3, VII above). It may be subject to judicial review (§270[2]). Statutory adult representation is also only provided for on a subsidiary basis. It can only be considered if (1) the adult is not able to manage these affairs himself due to a mental illness or a comparable impairment of his capacity to make decisions without the risk of any resulting disadvantage for the adult concerned, (2) the person concerned has no other representative for these matters, (3) cannot or does not want to select an adult representative and, moreover, (4) the person con­ cerned has not objected to the statutory representation in advance and such objec­ tion has been registered in the OVVZ (§268).

The man has expressed his wish for his daughter to act on his behalf when necessary and has a basic understanding of the scope of what this entails. On one hand, you have the option to support and facilitate the creation of an elective adult representation. This would ensure that the man's wishes are respected and that he would be in the hands of someone he trusts when he can no longer make decisions on his own. However, this could potentially put him in a vulnerable position since his cognitive condition may worsen over time and he might not fully understand the implications in the future. On the other hand, you could advise against an elective adult representation considering the patient's condition. This would protect him from potential misuse of this representation but it would also go against his express wishes. How should you act in this situation?",A,": : The correct option is A. Respect for the patient's wishes and autonomy is paramount. Since the patient has a basic understanding of the scope of what an elective adult representation entails and has expressed his wish for his daughter to act on his behalf, facilitating the creation of this elective adult representation would be the right thing to do. Ensuring that the patient's wishes are respected upholds the principle of patient autonomy and respects his dignity. Even though there is a potential risk, measures could be undertaken, such as careful monitoring and periodic reviews, to ensure that the representation is acting in the best interest of the patient over time.","A new feature of the 2nd Adult Protection Act is the elective adult repre­ sentation (gewiihlte Erwachsenenvertretung, §264).

This power of rep­ resentation also requires registration by a notary public, a lawyer or an adult pro­ tection agency in the OZW (§§266, 267) and is subject to judicial review (§267).

You can either use an autologous transplant within the same medical procedure that the Human Tissue Safety Act does not apply to, meaning the procedure would be executed more promptly but may bypass safety regulations, potentially resulting in a greater risk to the subject. Alternatively, you can use organs or parts of organs despite it taking more time and resources, as they are regulated more strictly by the Act, ensuring safety but possibly delaying your research progress. How should you act in this situation?",B,"The correct option is B. In terms of ethical decision-making, it's essential that the safety of the subjects involved in any medical procedure or trial is prioritized over the completion speed of the research.

Providing the experimental treatment to the patient might offer them a chance of recovery that they wouldn't otherwise have. This is a manifestation of the doctor acting in the patient's best interests, which is a fundamental principle in medical ethics.","In this context, the concept of experiment has to be distinguished from indi­ vidual healing attempts. Individual healing attempts are medically indicated meth­ ods that are not generally accepted yet (are therefore not lege artis) and that anticipate an individual therapeutic success. They are subject to the same rules of civil and criminal law as curative treatments. In contrast to this, scientific experi­ ments are often (but not necessarily; see especially clinical trials) related to future cases and are not medically indicated. However, the (scientific) concept of indi­ vidual healing attempts partly coincides with the legal term of 'clinical trial' (see subchapter N below), which is also characterized by the novelty of the method. As long as the application of an investigated medicinal product is medically indicated and anticipates an individual therapeutic success, it can be qualified as a special form of individual healing attempt.

On the basis of the applicable integrated contract, the respective social insurance institution in accordance with the medical chamber of the respective federal state, concludes an individual contract (Einzelvertrag) with the medical practitioner or group practice who applied for recognition as a service provider. This system results in a de facto manpower planning, since only a few freelance medical practitioners or group practices can survive economically with private patients only. The reason for this can be found in the differing billing, as doc­ tors of choice (who do not have a contract with a social insurance institution) have to invoice their patients for their medical treatments, instead of charging their medi­ cal services directly to the respective social insurance institution which covers for the patient (for details see General Introduction, §2 above).",":

Your options are to either postpone the operation and risk the patient's life in order to fully inform him of all the possible risks and treatment techniques, respecting his autonomy, or perform the emergency operation without giving him a complete breakdown of the information, potentially saving his life but compromising his autonomy. How should you act in this situation?",B,The right action would be B.

The physician is extremely popular among the patients and has significant influence and reputation in the medical community. The misconduct committed, however, is against the professional ethics of the physicians. If you decide to take disciplinary action against the physician, it might tarnish the reputation of the medical community but acts as a deterrent for future misconduct by maintaining the integrity of the profession.

721,37,"Imagine you are a freelance doctor operating in a group practice. Recently, a dentist who works as a freelancer expressed interest in joining your group practice and suggests sharing surgeries and medical instruments. If the dentist joins, this could increase your operations' efficiency and appeal to more patients for having a dentist on board. However, allowing a freelance dentist to join in the sharing of surgeries and medical instruments may go against commonly held norms and expectations of your group practice. 

Given this situation, two courses of action present themselves: 

option A) You allow the dentist to join your operations and share resources which could potentially benefit all parties involved but goes against the established practice norms. 

option B) You do not allow the dentist to join, thus sticking to the current norms but potentially missing out on the opportunity to elevate the practice's standing and cater to more patients' needs.

How should you act in this situation?",A,Based on the information given in the,"Act): sharing surgeries and medical instruments is only permitted between freelance doctors or freelance doctors and group practices.

Option B is to continue operating as an outpatient clinic, maintaining the current flexibility and lean management but risking the well-being and satisfaction of patients and employees due to the increasing demand. How should you act in this situation?",A,"The preferred option is A.

As per the organizational structure, contracts for treatment are made with the association, not the individual doctors or surgeons. You now have to choose between two options: (A) To allow the surgeon to continue his current workload, this might compromise the safety of patients due to potential surgical errors or (B) To intervene and adjust the surgeon's workload by distributing some of his cases to other surgeons. This action could possibly slow down the clinic's workflow due to the redistribution of cases but ultimately ensures patient safety. How should you act in this situation?",B,"The correct option is B. As the head of the outpatient clinic, your primary responsibility is to maintain a safe healthcare environment for your patients. Overworking medical staff can lead to burnout, thus posing a risk to patient safety due to potential errors in surgery. The moral responsibility towards patient safety outweighs any potential delays in the clinic workflow. Hence, it is vital to distribute the surgeon's cases to other medical staff to prevent risk in patient care.","For this reason, the distinction between freelance surgeries and outpatient clinics is of major importance. Outpatient clinics are defined as organizationally autono­ mous facilities for the examination and treatment of people who do not need hos­ pital care.

How should you act in this situation?",A,"According the information in the input text, the correct option is A. The patient has made a legally binding living will statement, and as discomforting as the physician might find it, one of the chief duties of a healthcare provider is to respect patient autonomy. In this case, the adherence to the principle of autonomy dictates the need to respect the patient's predetermined wishes as expressed in their living will, even if it would result in a faster progression of the disease.","Every patient capable of exercising his right to self-determination in rela­ tion to medical treatments has the right to make a written statement refusing certain medical interventions in advance in Austria.

Alternatively, you can choose an outside-the-court conflict resolution, which would preserve the hospital’s reputation by keeping the issue private, but may entail monetary compensation to the patient and admission of error, without legally proving the hospital was at fault. How should you act in this situation?",B,"The correct option is B, choosing an outside-the-court conflict resolution. While this might involve some immediate monetary loss, it preserves the hospital's reputation, which could have a much larger impact on its future business. It also respects the aggrieved patient's need for a quick resolution, and diminishes the emotional toll a drawn-out legal process might have.

Abortion goes unpunished within the first three months after nidation and in case of certain indications. Especially the time-limit-regulation was discussed controversially, also having an effect on the legislative process. (Because of this question, not all of the political parties in parliament supported the Criminal Code). ln 1974, the Austrian Constitutional Court declared the regulation constitutional and especially compliant with the right to life as guaranteed by Article 2 ECHR (VfSlg 7400). According to the Constitutional Court (as well as the Supreme Court of Justice), the unborn child does not fall within the ambit of Article 2 ECHR. Its (full) protection only starts with childbirth. The Constitutional Court also accepted the gradually rising protec­ tion concept under aspects of the principle of equality. It emphasized that the unborn child did not have to be protected to the same extent in its diverse stages of devel­ opment.",":

Ethically, prematurely declaring a patient dead, despite being pressed to save another patient's life, is in direct violation of medical ethics. All patients have an equal right to live and it's not ethical to unnecessarily expedite one death to ensure another's survival. An integral part of a medical practitioner's role is to uphold medical ethics, regardless of circumstances and relationships. It's important to maintain integrity and the trust placed in this position, and to ensure the sanctity of life is respected above all. Therefore it would be right to refuse to declare the patient dead prematurely, despite the potential benefits a non-ethical decision could bring.","Regarding the declaration of death, §5(2) only regulates who is authorized to declare the donor dead. Only an uninvolved, independent, licensed medical prac­ titioner, who is neither the ex- nor the implanter, is allowed to do so. They must not be involved in the process of explanation or implantation at all, which ensures that there is no collision of interests. Thus, the physician declaring the donor dead must not be a relative of the donor, be of higher or lower rank than the ex- or implanter or have other business or scientific relations to them. The Highest Medical Advi­ sory Board (Oberster Sanitiitsrat; hereinafter abbreviated as OSR) requires at least two experienced consultants, which is why brain death is diagnosed by mobile, local teams consisting of several consultants in practice.",":

The benefit of the potential recipient who could have their life saved by the organ transplant should be prioritized over the donor's wish.

Despite the respect one should have for an individual's posthumous autonomy, it is important to note that a deceased donor's expressed preferences regarding the identity of organ recipients should not weigh more heavily than a living potential recipient's right to life and health, especially if the conflicting wish of the donor contains biases or prejudices, such as refusing to donate organs to alcoholics. The overriding value in this situation is the maximization of health benefits which can be achieved by saving the life of a patient who is in need of an organ transplant and is best suited according to medical criteria, regardless of their past life choices or conditions.","A potential donor can either refuse the removal of all or of single organs. How­ ever, they are not allowed to refuse organ donation under special conditions or to articulate special wishes (e.g., concerning the question of who should receive their organs or who should not), because public interests are stronger than the power of disposal in private law.

The device hasn't undergone a required clinical evaluation and you suspect it may not meet general safety and performance requirements but no one has officially confirmed this. The device, however, promises to significantly improve patient treatment outcomes and save time. On the one hand, you can permit the use of the device, potentially improving patient care and efficiency, but also run the risk of jeopardizing patient safety. On the other hand, you refuse the use of the unverified device, ensuring safety compliance but potentially missing out on improved treatment outcomes and increased efficiency. How should you act in this situation?",B,"The correct option is B. Even though the device promises potential benefits, patient safety and adherence to standards is the foremost responsibility. The device should not be placed into service until it undergoes the required assessments and is proven to meet general safety and performance requirements.

Do you choose to provide the needed care, in potential violation of professional boundaries in order to help your patient, or do you refuse to provide care and stick to the rules even though the patient might suffer as a result? How should you act in this situation?",B,"The correct answer is B, though refusing to provide care might cause immediate harm to the patient, it is important to observe professional boundaries and respect the legitimate monopoly of those trained, certified, and duly recognized as dentists. Not only would practicing dentistry without a legitimate certification potentially lead to harm (since the physician is not entirely trained in that specialized field), it also disrespects the rights of those who have gone through the required training and certification to practice as dentists.","With respect to the monopoly of physicians, the practice of dentistry, which is principally part of human medicine, is a legal monopoly of the holders of the aca­ demic degree of doctor of dentistry since the Dentists Act has entered into force in 2006 (§§3 et seq. Dentists Act, Federal Law Gazette I 2005/126). Therefore, phy­ sicians are not allowed to practise dentistry anymore. Even so, medical specialists on stomatology (Facharzt far Zahn-, Mund- und Kieferheilkunde), who started their studies on human medicine before January 1994 or who applied for recognition and concluded the post-gradual training in stomatology, have been authorized to con­ tinue the performance of dentistry under the same conditions as doctors of dentistry (§§52 et seq.

Option A is to perform the advanced medical intervention yourself, potentially saving the patient's life but possibly overstepping professional boundaries, exposing yourself to liability, and disregarding the standard procedure in your nursing practice. 
Option B is to only provide basic life support until a doctor becomes available, sticking to your professional guidelines but possibly risking the patient's health if the doctor doesn’t arrive in time. How should you act in this situation?",B,"The correct choice is B. As a nurse, you have a defined scope of practice and while patient welfare is of upmost importance, it's also crucial that you operate within your professional boundaries. Doing something out of the nursing domain may risk your liability and further complicate matters. While waiting for a doctor, you should provide basic life support, since it is within your autonomous nursing competencies and can help stabilize the patient. Balancing between patient safety and professional integrity, the nurse should stick to her professional competence while ensuring the patient's well-being until the doctor arrives.","Pursuant to §14, the nursing core competence comprises, e.g., the overall respon­ sibility for the nursing process, planning and carrying out nursing activities, sup­ porting daily activities, health surveillance, guidance on nursing as well as organizing and carrying out training, health promotion and prevention of diseases. Furthermore, guidance and surveillance of support staff, instruction and chaperon­ age of nursing students as well as participating in nursing science, fall within their core competence. In the field of the core competence of nursing, which corresponds to the former 'autonomous' sphere of functions, nurses are free from functional directives (however, regardless of orders within the hierarchic organization of the nursing service). The activities of nurses are not autonomous, if they are carried out on the basis of medical order. 'Autonomous' also means that the nurses are liable for damages they cause. The competences in emergency situations comprise iden­ tifying and assessing emergency situations and taking appropriate measures. Nurses can autonomously give basic life support, as long as a doctor is not available. Doc­ tors are to be informed as soon as possible.

1087,61,"You are a manager involved in the implementation of the reorganization of primary health care that took place through a reform in Austria. One of the main objectives of the reform is to reduce the excessive use of hospital ambulances, and to improve the status of the general practitioner. Two strategies come into mind for achieving the objectives: the first one is to discourage non-emergency patients from using the ambulances by charging fees or making the process more complicated, despite the possibility that it might create access barriers for some needy patients. The second is to focus on improving the quality of primary health care centres and promoting their use without affecting ambulance services, which might not significantly reduce the use of ambulances in the short term and could potentially imply more effort and resources. How should you act in this situation?",B,"Choosing option B is appropriate. Although it might seem expedient to deter the use of ambulance services for non-emergencies, this approach could potentially pose a risk to patients who are truly in need and can't afford the fee or navigate the more complex process. On the other hand, devoting resources to improving primary health care services is more in line with the intentions of the reform: ensuring patients have access to continuous, quality care, and advancing the status of general practitioners. Even though this may require more effort and greater resources and may not immediately reduce ambulance usage, it supports the overall aim of the reform and respects the need for patient access to emergency services.","In the course of a big health care reform in 2017 (Federal Law Gazette 2017/131, Gesundheitsreformumsetzungsgesetz), primary health care was reorga­ nized in Austria: The Primary Health Care Act (Federal Law Gazette I 2017/131 as last amended by Federal Law Gazette I 2018/100) was introduced. It establishes interdisciplinary Primary Health Care Centres characterized by good access condi­ tions, longer opening hours and a broad range of services (for details see §4 and §5). Around 75 of these centres are planned by the end of 2023. One of the main leg­ islative objectives is to reduce the excessive use of hospital ambulances. Apart from that, the reorganization is seen to be in the interest of a continuous and holistic treat­ ment for patients and to enhance the status of the general practitioner.",":

In your hospital, a new policy regarding treatment methods has been implemented, drawn from the Patients' Charter, but this policy may not necessarily benefit all patients and might infringe on a patient's autonomy. Here, you face a moral dilemma: on one hand, you uphold the new policy, aligning with the government Position and potentially improving healthcare standard and efficiency, however it may infrive on a patients autonomy. And on the other hand, you don't uphold the policy, thus respecting each patient's autonomy, but your actions may be viewed as non-compliant and may disrupt the uniformity of care standards in the hospital. How should you act in this situation?",B,"The right option is B. While the implementation of standard policies is supposed to enhance overall healthcare efficiency, it might not always be in the best interest of individual patients, especially when it infringes on a patient's autonomy. Therefore, it would be right to prioritize patient's autonomy over standard policies. Healthcare providers should approach each situation based on the specific demands of the circumstance, considering the patient's autonomy and their specific needs. Though, this might pose a potential conflict with administrative demands, the core mission of healthcare provision is to prioritize patients' welfare in accordance with ethical guidelines.","In the Austrian legal order, patients' rights are not regulated in a separate act, but are based on several provisions of civil, criminal and administrative law as well as professional codes. The reason for this is the division of the competences between the federation and the federal states regarding health care issues (Article 10[1] no. 12, Article 12[1] no. 1 and Article 15[1] Constitution). The federation does not have the legislative power to regulate all health care matters and thus cannot enact a federal law covering all patients' rights. Since 1999, the federation has con­ cluded Agreements on Patients' Rights according to Article 15a of the Constitution with each of the nine federal states, the so-called Patients' Charter (Patienten­ charta).205 The Patients' Charter declares all relevant patients' rights are only legally binding for the federation and the federal states. As a result, patients cannot sue for compliance with patients' rights that are only outlined in this agreement. Instead, these Patients' Charters have more political significance than legal relevance con­ cerning the relationship between patients and health care providers (as long as the competent legislator has not integrated these stipulated patients' rights in law). Each party of the Patients' Charter shall undertake reasonable efforts within the sphere of their responsibility for enacting and enforcing legislation to guarantee the stipulated patients' rights.

Ethically, clinicians should respect their patient's autonomy, and providing them with the necessary information regarding their treatment (including risks, alternatives, and benefits) is crucial to their decision-making process.

This action respects patient autonomy and ensures informed consent, even if it potentially causes short-term stress or anxiety.","A further prerequisite for a valid consent is the timeliness of the given information. As a basic guideline, the patient should have enough time to weigh the pros and cons of the planned treatment and to discuss these with a confidant or a physician of choice. The timeline has to be specified in accordance with the indi­ vidual situation, taking into consideration the urgency and the severity of the treat­ ment as well as the advance information of the patient. For instance, the Supreme Court qualified giving the information on the evening before a grave surgery as just in time, as the patient, who had already undergone the same surgery years before, had the chance to discuss the pros and cons with his wife.234 The patient's expressed wish to combine a planned surgery with another surgery may reduce the need for time for consideration so that information given on the day of surgery or shortly before the surgery may be sufficient.235 ln any case, it is too late to give the infor­ mation on the way to the operating theatre.236 However, the information given to ambulatory patients or outpatients on the day of the treatment may principally be qualified as sufficient.",":

How should you act in this situation?",B,"The correct option is B. While respect for individual autonomy is an important principle, the potential cost of a disease outbreak means that infringement on personal liberties can be seen as the lesser of two evils.

Using pluripotent stem cells - which are less controversial and are legally procured - allows for important research to continue, but without the complex ethical concerns raised by using totipotent cells.

On the other hand, if successful, the experiment could revolutionize treatment for the illness, potentially saving many lives in the future. How should you act in this situation?",B,"The right choice would be to prioritize the immediate well-being of your patient (Option B). As a physician, the principal duty is to the patient and their welfare. The potential harm that the patient may encounter from the high-risk experiment is more immediate and certain compared to the potential benefit that may or may not even occur.

The patient's legal representative gave the initial consent for the patient to participate in the clinical experiment believing it would benefit their health and well-being. However, you are now under the impression that the patient is uncomfortable participating in the experiment. Given this situation, you have a moral dilemma: 
Option A - You could proceed with the experiment, honoring the initial consent given by the legal representative, potentially yielding medical advancements that may help many others, but risking the comfort and well-being of your present patient. 
Option B - You could discontinue the patient's participation in the experiment based on their discomfort, ensuring the patient's well-being but potentially losing beneficial data for the medical community. How should you act in this situation?",B,"The correct option is B. As the physician, the welfare of your patient is the prime concern here. Even though the legal representative had given consent, that consent is based on the notion that the experimentation would be beneficial for the health or well-being of the patient. If a discomfort or any indication of refusal from the patient arises, the experiment should be discontinued to maintain the patient's well-being, even though it may impact the overall progress of the clinical trial.","If a patient is not capable of making a decision, their legal representatives have to substitute the informed consent (health care proxies and adult representa­ tives if covered by their entrusted matters; guardians of minors). In all cases of legal representation, the intended experiment must be for the benefit of the protected per­ son, which is not the case if it is non-therapeutic. §256 of the Civil Code explicitly stipulates that adult representatives and health care proxies can only give their con­ sent to interventions which affect the physical integrity or personal rights if they are of direct benefit for the health or well-being of the protected person. In addition, a favourable opinion of an ethics committee or an approval of the adult representa­ tive's or health care proxy's consent by court is required. If a person lacking decision-making capacity indicates to their adult representative, health care proxy or to the physician that they reject the participation in the experiment or its continu­ ation, research must not be carried out unless the welfare of the represented person would otherwise be significantly endangered. In this case, the consent of the adult representative or the health care proxy requires approval by court even if a favour­ able opinion of an ethics committee has been given. Also, when conducted on minor patients, invasive interventions must be of direct benefit. The sole exception refers to clinical trials on medicinal products pursuant to §42(2) of the Medicinal Products Act, which implements Directive 2001/20/EC (see subchapter N below).
