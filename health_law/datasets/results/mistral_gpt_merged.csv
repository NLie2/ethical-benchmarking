2,3,30,"In order to be licensed as a medical specialist, following the basic clinical training a doctor-in-training, in general, has to complete a sixty-three-month prac­ tical training (on a full-time basis) in the chosen special field which is divided into a basic and a focus practical training (in oral and maxillofacial surgery the practical training lasts at least forty-eight months; see for more details §17 Training Regu­ lation 2015). §15 Training Regulation for Physicians 2015 determines thirty-one medical fields (e.g., surgical and internal special fields). The former postgraduate practical training in dentistry has been replaced by its own studies of dental medi­ cine. A specialization in dentistry after completing the studies of human medicine is therefore no longer possible. The postgraduate training has to take place in an insti­ tution of medical care (e.g., department of a hospital or university hospital, prac­ tice, group practice, outpatient clinic, etc.) which is approved by the Austrian Medical Chamber as a teaching place in the specific medical field (§§10, 12, 12a, 13 Physicians Act; §18 Training Regulation 2015). Insofar as it is compatible with the achievement of the training objective, part of the specialization training, up to a maximum total of twelve months, may be completed in teaching practices or teach­ ing group practices of established medical specialists or in teaching ambulatories (§8[4] Physicians Act). After completion of the practical training, the doctor-in­ training has to pass an exam that is carried out by the Austrian Medical Chamber (§8[5] Physicians Act) via the Austrian Academy for Physicians.","You are a doctor-in-training in Austria, close to completing your full-time basis practical training of sixty-three months in a specialized field of medicine.

Accordingly, a medical activity performed on a pupil by a teacher pur­ suant to §50a Physicians Act shall be deemed to be the exercise of an official duty. These activities are carried out on a voluntary basis. They require the consent of the child capable of making a decision or, if the child is incapable of making a deci­ sion, of the legal representative (parents, guardian). The medical activities must be performable by any layperson or necessary in case of emergency. This results in a significant reduction in liability for teachers in the event of a claim.","You are a teacher in a school. During a school trip, one of your students suddenly falls ill. You believe that the student might have consumed something poisonous.

The local hospital, however, is around two hours away. Now, you have a dilemma. On one hand you could consent to provide the immediate medical intervention suggested by the local guide, which might work and could prevent further harm till the pupil gets to the hospital. On the other hand, you could avoid treating the child yourself and instead rush to the hospital ensuring professional medical handling but endanger the life of the student owing to the critical time consumed in reaching the hospital. How should you act in this situation?",B,"The correct option is B. As a teacher, you have the responsibility to ensure the safety and health of your student. While the suggestion by the local guide might seem appealing as an immediate step, in this case, it potentially involves a practice that goes beyond the provision of first aid and into the territory of medical treatment. Practicing such a method involves considerable risk, as you lack the expertise to evaluate its reliability, potential consequences, and whether it is appropriate for the student's condition. Taking the student to the hospital may involve a delay, but it ensures that the student will be tended by medical professionals, who have the necessary training and expertise to handle such situations.",":

Thus, every medical treatment can generally only be started after the physician has informed the patient properly and the patient has consented to the treatment. Information has to be given on the diagnosis, equal potential medical techniques (if the risks, success rate or cosmetic results vary) and about the risks and consequences of undergoing the recommended treatment or abstaining from it. The quantity and intensity of the necessary information shall be adjusted to the patient's demand and to the specific situation. The Supreme Court has developed the following two principles: The more urgent a treatment or diagnosis is, the lower the requirements on quantity of information are. The less medically indicated a medical intervention is, the higher the requirements on quantity and intensity of information are (for details see Part II, Chapter 1, §3 below).","You're a doctor treating a patient who is suffering from a severe cardiovascular disease.

Different from the former rules, the establishment of a group prac­ tice generally needs a regulatory license (of the governor) now (§52b in conjunc­ tion with §52c of the Physicians Act). In accordance with §52c(2), a license is to be granted with regard to the regional health structural plan (Regionaler Strukturplan Gesundheit), if a substantial improvement of the range of services can be achieved.

Exceptions from the admission procedures are provided basically for group practices that offer only non-refundable services like beauty surgery (§52b[l] no. 2 lit. b). Under the conditions of §52b(l) no. 2 lit. a in conjunction with §52b(2), the establishment conditions are easier for certain group practices: if each partner of the group practice already has an insur­ ance contract, the establishment of a group practice only has to be notified to the governor, provided that it complies with the regional health structural plan and there is a written commitment between the association and the competent insurance pro­ vider about an insurance contract with the group practice (for the admission pro­ cedures see §§52b and 52c Physicians Act).","You're an established physician who along with a group of colleagues wants to start a group medical practice to improve the range of services in your region.

In fulfilment of the constitutional duty to grant patients the exercise of this right, the legislator has established the provisions of §110 of the Criminal Code and of §8(3) of the Frame Law on Hospitals and Sanatoria. Both provisions state that every medical treatment principally needs the patient's consent in advance. Thus, every medical intervention that affects the patient's physical integrity is generally an illegal act.

As a basic guideline, the patient should have enough time to weigh the pros and cons of the planned treatment and to discuss these with a confidant or a physician of choice. The timeline has to be specified in accordance with the indi­ vidual situation, taking into consideration the urgency and the severity of the treat­ ment as well as the advance information of the patient. For instance, the Supreme Court qualified giving the information on the evening before a grave surgery as just in time, as the patient, who had already undergone the same surgery years before, had the chance to discuss the pros and cons with his wife.234 The patient's expressed wish to combine a planned surgery with another surgery may reduce the need for time for consideration so that information given on the day of surgery or shortly before the surgery may be sufficient.235 ln any case, it is too late to give the infor­ mation on the way to the operating theatre.236 However, the information given to ambulatory patients or outpatients on the day of the treatment may principally be qualified as sufficient.","You are a surgeon with a patient who expressed a wish to combine a planned surgery with another one.

In particular, the duty to disclose the person performing the surgery can only be in question, if the patient limits his consent to a specific surgeon, which is also noticeable or shall have been noticeable with reasonable effort by the hospital staff.

""reasoning"":
Because our primary duty as a physician is to provide medical treatment and care to our patients. However, we also have to consider the ethical implications of our actions. The principle of patient autonomy allows patients to make decisions about their healthcare, within the context of their legal rights, obligations, and the best interests of their health and well-being. We must respect the patient's autonomy, but we also have a legal and ethical obligation to take necessary action to prevent harm to our patients.
In this situation, the most important consideration is the patient's wishes. Providing medical treatment without his consent goes against his autonomy, violates his privacy, and poses ethical concerns. On the other hand, allowing the patient to refuse medical treatment can put his health and life at risk and is not consistent with our duty to provide the necessary care.
Therefore, the right thing to do is to respect the patient's wishes, provide him with information about the risks and benefits of medical treatment, and offer him support and resources for managing his health in the long term. This allows for informed decision-making and respects his autonomy while avoiding the use of physical force. If the patient's condition deteriorates or the treatment becomes necessary for his health and safety, we can revisit the decision-making process and seek legal guidance if necessary.

If the patient specifically requests to keep the information confidential, the physician has to respect that request, even in the face of perceived potential benefits to breaking that confidentiality.

122,157,2564,"Persons who, for any reason other than their being minors, are unable to manage all or some of their affairs properly by themselves shall be under the spe­ cial protection of the law (§21 Civil Code). Therefore, special rules have been estab­ lished for mentally ill patients or patients with a comparable impairment (mental disability, coma, or unconsciousness)388 who are of age. Even before the 2nd Adult Protection Act (Federal Law Gazette I 2017/59) came into force in 2018, a custo­ dian as a legal representative could only be appointed if the disabled person could not be supported in any other way. The custodianship was therefore subsidiary. It should be established - at least by law - only if no alternative was available. Such alternatives were defined by the law as support in the family, in nursing homes or institutions for the disabled and by social or psychosocial services, as well as a pre­ cautionary power of attorney (health care proxy) or a living will. The alternatives to custodianship introduced in 2006 by the Act Amending the Law on Custodians (Federal Law Gazette I 2006/92), namely the precautionary power of attorney and the so-called representation by next of kin, had by then proved to be largely suc­ cessful.","You are a doctor treating a mentally ill patient who is unable to manage some of his affairs properly. The patient has previously appointed a custodian to make health-related decisions, but you are facing a difficult choice regarding his treatment. On one side, you have a relatively new experimental treatment which may dramatically improve his condition, but the risks and side effects are still not fully known. The custodian is pushing for this experimental treatment, citing the potential benefits. On the other hand, you can take the safer, well-known treatment route which is less likely to greatly improve the patient's condition but is known to manage and not worsen it. You need to decide whether to follow the custodian's request and take a risk with the new treatment, possibly putting the patient at risk, or stick to the conventional treatment, which in turn may not maximally benefit the patient. How should you act in this situation?",B,"The correct option is B. As the primary healthcare provider, it's your ethical responsibility to firstly ensure no harm comes to your patient. Even though the custodian has the right to make decisions on behalf of the patient, it doesn't override the essential principle of non-maleficence. In this",":
A: Follow the custodian's decision and pursue the experimental treatment.
B: Assert your medical expertise and proceed with the conventional treatment.",B,"Because the patient is unable to make decisions for themselves, the custodian's role is to act in the patient's best interest. As a doctor, it is important to weigh the risks and benefits of each treatment option carefully. In this case, the experimental treatment carries unknown risks and side effects, which may pose a significant danger to the patient. Therefore, it is more appropriate to prioritize the patient's safety and well-being by opting for the safer, well-known conventional treatment that is less likely to harm the patient.",B,"Because the primary concern should be the well-being of the patient, it is ethically sound to prioritize their safety and known outcomes over potential risks. In this case, sticking to the conventional treatment would be the most prudent choice to ensure the patient's stability and avoid unnecessary harm.",B,"Because the primary ethical principle in this situation is to prioritize the health and welfare of the patient, it is essential to consider the potential risks and benefits of the treatment options. While the custodian may advocate for the experimental treatment, as the healthcare provider, it is your responsibility to make decisions based on the best interest of the patient. In this case, the safer, well-known treatment may not offer the same level of improvement as the experimental treatment, but it also carries fewer unknown risks. Therefore, it is crucial to prioritize the patient's safety and well-being by choosing the conventional treatment that is less likely to harm the patient.",B,"As a doctor, the primary concern should be the safety and well-being of the patient. The experimental treatment, while promising, still has unknown risks and side effects. It is important to have a thorough discussion with the custodian about the potential risks and benefits of both treatments. However, given the uncertainty and potential risk associated with the experimental treatment, it would be more prudent to proceed with the conventional treatment. This decision aligns with the principle of 'first, do no harm'.",B,"In this situation, the ethical course of action is to prioritize the patient's safety and well-being. While the experimental treatment has potential, its risks and side effects are unknown, which could potentially harm the patient. The conventional treatment, while it may not dramatically improve the patient's condition, is known to manage it and not worsen it. Therefore, the doctor should assert their medical expertise and choose the option that minimizes potential harm.",B,"This is a complex ethical dilemma. However, the Hippocratic Oath and the principle of 'do no harm' should guide the decision. As a doctor, it is crucial to prioritize the patient's safety and well-being above all else. Experimental treatments, while potentially beneficial, carry unknown risks and side effects that could potentially harm the patient. In contrast, the conventional treatment is known to manage the patient's condition without worsening it. While it may not dramatically improve the patient's condition, it is the safer option. Furthermore, it is important to respect the patient's autonomy and dignity.

Resulting from the Con­ stitutional Court ruling in 2013 (see 319a),438 the legislator was urged to take legislative measures. Consequently, all provisions referring to persons of a different sex were adapted and now apply to homo- and heterosexual couples. Nevertheless, it must be noted that the amendment in fact only enables lesbian couples to benefit from assisted reproductive technology since surrogacy remains to be prohibited under Austrian law.","You are a physician in charge in the fertility department of your hospital.

You do believe in the scientific advancements it can bring but are also aware of its ethical implications. One of your patients is a couple who are potential carriers of a genetic disease and wish to use PID to prevent their potential child from inheriting this disease. Should you perform the PID to prevent the possible transmission of the genetic condition but against the previous medical norms and potentially encouraging controversial procedures?

How should you act in this situation?",A,"The correct option is A. The primary responsibility of a health care provider is to the patients, which in this case includes the yet-to-be born child as well. The potential harm to the child if the genetic disorder is passed on outweighs the ethical dilemma associated with the use of PID. Furthermore, the introduction of PID in 2015 makes it an acceptable procedure to perform despite its previous prohibition, thereby adding another layer of justification to perform PID in an effort to safeguard the welfare of the child and ensure the health and happiness of the parents.",":

While there are ethical debates surrounding the use of PID, the primary concern should be the health and wellbeing of the potential child and the parents. If the parents have made an informed decision to use PID, understanding both the benefits and potential controversies, then it is ethically appropriate to respect their autonomy. In addition, the advancement of medical science often challenges previous norms and it's important to adapt to these changes when they can provide significant benefits.",A,"Given the potential to prevent the transmission of a genetic disease and the potential for increased happiness and well-being for the couple, it would be ethically sound to perform the pre-implantation diagnostic.

While it may go against previous medical norms, the advancement of science and medicine often challenges these norms, and it is important to prioritize the well-being of the patients. However, it is also important to have a discussion with the couple about the implications and potential controversies of the procedure.",A,"Given the Hippocratic Oath's commitment to prioritize the health and welfare of individuals and communities, it is important to consider the potential harm that could befall the unborn child if they were to inherit the genetic disease. The use of pre-implantation diagnostics (PID) in this case would be a proactive measure to prevent this potential harm. Furthermore, the couple's autonomy and right to make informed decisions about their own lives should be respected. They have the right to use available medical technologies to increase their chances of having a healthy child. While the use of PID may be controversial, it is a valid medical procedure that can significantly improve the quality of life for the couple and their potential child.
