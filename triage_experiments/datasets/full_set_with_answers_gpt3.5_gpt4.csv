Therefore, he requires immediate medical attention in order to minimize blood loss and prevent potential life-threatening complications such as irreversible shock.",IMMEDIATE,"The patient presents with bleeding from the proximal right thigh, which indicates a serious injury that potentially threatens life. The fact that the bleeding is pulsatile suggests arterial bleeding, which is life-threatening and needs immediate attention. As such, when the tourniquet is removed, the bleeding becomes critical and the patient's status can deteriorate significantly within 60 minutes or less.",IMMEDIATE,"The patient is severely injured, not able to move on his own, and has a major and life-threatening injury that needs immediate assistance, as evidenced by the pulsatile bleeding when the tourniquet is removed.",IMMEDIATE,"Given that the patient is not ambulatory and is bleeding from the thigh, with the blood flow being pulsatile when the tourniquet is removed, signifies arterial hemorrhage.

However, he has the ability to talk, implying a clear state of consciousness and no immediate danger to vital organs. His absence of left dorsalis pedis pulse indicates a circulatory problem in his lower extremity, but the presence of his posterior tibial pulse and good cap refill suggest that there is still circulation occurring in the foot. His condition needs medical attention but it's not life-threatening.",DELAYED,"The patient has a deformity of the left ankle and is non-ambulatory. However, he is conscious and has a pulse. The injury, although it requires treatment, does not appear to be life threatening, his vital signs are stable, and he may not need immediate attention when compared to other severely injured patients.

Though she has minor burns, it's clear that she won't require immediate assistance and her injuries are not threatening in comparison to other patients who might have life-threatening ones. Hence, she can be treated later.",MINOR,"The child's respiratory rate is normal for their age (15-30 breaths/minute), they're alert, can speak and walk and only have a minor burn on a limb. These factors suggest they're stable and won't require immediate care.",MINOR,"Since the child has a functional respiratory rate, a pulse, and is alert, they can even speak and walk. The injury, a minor burn, is not life-threatening. Therefore, they belong in the MINOR triage category as they are stable but will need eventual treatment for the burn.",MINOR

This indicates a significant injury requiring immediate attention.
