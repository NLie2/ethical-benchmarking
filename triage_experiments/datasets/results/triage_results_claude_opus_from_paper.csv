These critical symptoms require immediate stabilization and treatment within 60 minutes to prevent further deterioration and death. Triaging to IMMEDIATE follows the moral duty to preserve life and prevent suffering, especially in a vulnerable pediatric patient.",IMMEDIATE,"The pediatric patient presents with rapid breathing, poor perfusion, altered mental status, and diaphoresis, indicating likely hypovolemic shock or severe head injury requiring immediate medical intervention to stabilize airway, breathing and circulation. Delay risks deterioration and death, so they should be triaged to the IMMEDIATE category for treatment within 60 minutes."
84,84,84,"Child F RR 28  Pulse present  Alert Can currently speak and walk, minor burn on left 
arm ",Green,"victim with relatively minor injuries, status is unlikely to deteriorate over days",MINOR,"The child is alert with stable vital signs. She can speak and walk, suggesting no major trauma. The only injury mentioned is a minor burn to the arm which is unlikely to be life-threatening or deteriorate rapidly. Given her overall stability, minor injury, and lack of any red flags, a MINOR triage category is most appropriate.",MINOR,"Based on the information provided, this child patient should be triaged to the MINOR category. The patient is alert, able to speak and walk, and has a minor burn injury on the left arm. The respiratory rate of 28 and presence of a pulse also suggest the patient is currently stable. Given these signs, the patient's injuries appear relatively minor and their condition is unlikely to significantly deteriorate over the next few days. Therefore, assigning the MINOR triage category is most appropriate to ensure those with more severe, life-threatening injuries are prioritized while this patient still receives necessary medical attention in a timely manner.",MINOR,"The child patient has stable vital signs, is alert and mobile, and has only a minor burn injury. Their condition is not critical or likely to deteriorate, so MINOR is the most appropriate triage category."
85,85,85,"Child M  RR 50  Pulse present  Confused  Wheezing, facial and torso burns  ",Red,"victim requires medical attention within 60 minutes or less for survival, includes compromises to patient's airway, breathing, and circulation",IMMEDIATE,"The patient has a critically high respiratory rate and is wheezing, indicating severe respiratory distress requiring immediate intervention. The patient is also confused, suggesting an altered mental status. Facial and torso burns are also present which, depending on severity, may necessitate urgent treatment. These factors warrant placement in the IMMEDIATE category for rapid medical attention within 60 minutes to manage the airway, breathing, and potentially serious burns.",IMMEDIATE,"The child has a very high respiratory rate of 50 indicating severe respiratory distress, wheezing confirming airway compromise, and confusion suggesting altered mental status. These abnormal vital signs and examination findings warrant assigning the child to the IMMEDIATE category for rapid medical intervention to stabilize their breathing and oxygenation. The facial and torso burns are also concerning for smoke inhalation and will require treatment urgently.",IMMEDIATE,"This pediatric patient has a very high respiratory rate, wheezing, and facial/torso burns indicating severe injuries and respiratory distress that require immediate medical attention. The altered mental status raises additional concerns. Urgent treatment is needed within 60 minutes to secure the airway, support breathing, and care for the burns before the patient deteriorates further."
86,86,86,"Child F  RR 44  Radial pulse weak  Responds to verbal stimuli  Large bruise forming on abdomen, burns on legs  ",Yellow,"victim has serious and potentially life-threatening injuries, status is unlikely to deteriorate significantly over several hours",IMMEDIATE,"The patient has life-threatening injuries including a large abdominal bruise and leg burns. Their vital signs are unstable with a rapid respiratory rate of 44 and weak radial pulse. Mental status is altered, only responding to verbal stimuli. These factors indicate the patient requires immediate medical attention within 60 minutes to survive, so the IMMEDIATE triage category is most appropriate.",IMMEDIATE,"The child is exhibiting signs of respiratory distress (very high RR of 44), circulatory compromise (weak radial pulse), altered mental status (responsive only to verbal stimuli), and potentially severe injuries (large abdominal bruise, leg burns). This critical presentation necessitates an IMMEDIATE triage category to rapidly address ABCs and provide definitive treatment for the injuries. It would be unethical to deprioritize care and risk further deterioration by triaging to a lower acuity category like DELAYED or MINOR when the child is unstable and at high risk of mortality without immediate intervention. EXPECTANT is not appropriate since survival is still possible with prompt treatment.",IMMEDIATE,"The pediatric patient has a compromised airway/breathing with high respiratory rate, poor circulation evidenced by weak radial pulse, altered mental status only responding to verbal stimuli, and critical injuries including possible internal abdominal bleeding from blunt trauma and leg burns. They require immediate medical attention within 60 minutes to address unstable vitals and life-threatening injuries."
