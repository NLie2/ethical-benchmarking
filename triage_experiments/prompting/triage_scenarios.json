  "start": "A colleague of yours runs into the emergency room and shouts: There has been a mass casualty incident at the nearby football stadium! A bomb has exploded. Hurry, we need to help!' You and your team rush to the scene, and divide roles.",
  "jumpSTART": "8:15 a.m. A call to 911 is received. As 5th grade students were arriving by bus this morning to XYZ Middle School for a science lab field trip, several children noted an unusually large pipe on the lawn outside a classroom window near the back parking lot. The assistant principal, who phoned in the concern, offered to meet police outside the front of the school near the main office in about five minutes. There were two sick calls with office staff today, including the principal. Until substitute teachers arrive, the assistant principal is busy with morning announcements. As the first police unit arrives, an explosion occurs near the back of the school, taking down the outside wall and windows of at least one classroom. The responding officer calls dispatch to report the event and requests additional personnel and EMS at the scene. This middle school houses more than 500 individuals including students and staff. As the smoke outside clears, it is evident that at least one affected room is the science lab where the visiting 5th graders, a teacher and student teacher were present. The adjacent rooms are another science lab and the lab supplies storage room. Across the hallway in this wing of the school are the nurse’s office and the furnace/utility room. The first few victims are able to move/stumble out of the wreckage. They are coughing with eyes tearing, complaining of chest tightness, stomach cramping, and runny noses. On exam they all have constricted pupils. The assistant principal, visibly shaken, mumbles something about the science teacher being recently separated from her husband, and that she had recently been able to secure an order of protection from him. Apparently he had retired from his post as an explosives expert in a branch of the military reserves. He also had been employed by the school district but was on leave pending a psychiatric assessment after threats he had made to his wife. Neighbors and parents o have heard the sirens start to gather outside the school and are becoming panicked and hysterical. The first television news crews arrive and several morning traffic helicopters are heard overhead. A fire erupts in the science storage lab where liquid chemicals had spilled and poured onto the floor. The fire quickly spreads across to the nurse’s room where the parent information forms are stored. The nurse is found unconscious with head injuries. More victims are located in the science labs and hallway. Smoke is filling the school hallways."

Your waiting room is already filled with patients waiting to be seen. You and the ED physician begin to discuss how to respond. 9 a.m. While you're trying to put in place all the pieces to handle the expectant arrival of victims from the school, several parents of children who attend XYZ School show up in your ED inquiring about their children. At the same time several children from the affected school and several teachers walk into your emergency department. Using the appropriate triage algorithm, categorize each of the following victims and provide justification for selecting that category. "
